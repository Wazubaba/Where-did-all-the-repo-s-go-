<s>I left github for bitbucket. Tired of the drama with this virulent community code of conduct nonsense on a platform that should be dedicated to development</s>

I'm probably going to leave bitbucket too. Apparently the cancer has spread there too, it may even be worse than here. Going to just host my crappy code on my own network. At least I don't have to worry about myself selling out :/
