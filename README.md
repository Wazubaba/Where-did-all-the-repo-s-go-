# Where-did-all-the-repo-s-go-
Its been 5 years, maybe I should update this.

First I was on github, then the outrage mob ruined github with politics.
Next I was on bitbucket, then the outrage mob ruined bitbucket with politics.
After that I was on gitlab, then the outrage mob ruined gitlab with politics.
Finally, I found a place that wasn't driven by politics, cancel culture, and woke hysteria. That place, despairingly, is a 4chan-started git service called gitgud running their own gitlab instance.

It's sad that I have to rely on 4chan-esque hosting services just to have an approximation of free speech.

Most of the repos are just abandoned half-made game engines, random libs I made because I couldn't find any libs of the given focii up to my standards, and random software nobody but I will ever use.

Odds are good there is no way to contact me and frankly at this point I'm almost convinced to just swap full-time to various alt nets. Gemini looks rather nice, and there's always the fediverse if I can ever work up the will power to interact with people again after all of this mass-hysteria.
