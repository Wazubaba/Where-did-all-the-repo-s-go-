# Where did all the repos go?
Its been 5 years, maybe I should update this.

First I was on github, then the outrage mob ruined github with politics.

Next I was on bitbucket, then the outrage mob ruined bitbucket with politics.

After that I was on gitlab, then the outrage mob ruined gitlab with politics.

Finally, I found a place that wasn't driven by politics, cancel culture, and woke hysteria. That place, despairingly, is a 4chan-started git service called gitgud running their own gitlab instance. It's sad that I have to rely on 4chan-esque hosting services just to have an approximation of free speech.

Then I realized I was tired. I began to question "what is the point of this?". "Why am I writing all this and releasing it in hopes someone will benefit from it when the entire world has seemingly gone insane?". Things like that. Then I stopped bothering to share my code outside of with people I meet that need some. I'm certain no employer will ever hire me for this field, and frankly I don't want to be hired within it anyways.

Most of the repos are just abandoned half-made game engines, random libs I made because I couldn't find any libs of the given focii up to my standards, and random software nobody but I will ever use. I think most if not all are GPLv3 licensed.

Odds are good there is no viable way to contact me and frankly at this point I'm almost convinced to just swap full-time to various alt nets. Gemini looks rather nice, and there's always the fediverse if I can ever work up the will power to interact with people again after all of this mass-hysteria.
